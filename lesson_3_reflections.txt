When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To share your code or even let other people work on it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's always better to pull changes at a specific point in time where you think it's necessary. Auto pulling can't do this

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are copies made of repositories from one github profile to another. Clones are copies of repositories from the remoto to the local. Branches are made inside the local repository or inside github, then you can pull or push them.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

That way we can keep booth our local and remote repositories synchronized and we will avoid error while trying to perform actions like merging
